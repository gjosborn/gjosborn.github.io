In an effort to understand the impact of purchasing an EV both on our energy consumption and the operating cost I am working on a Dash app, created with python, that will give me a better idea of my energy usage and the impact the EV will have on it. I also plan on using it to compare the different cost plans offered by my utility company so I can make an informed choice on the cheapest option based on our energy usage. My utility company gives me the ability to download detailed energy usage down to 15 minute intervals in a standardized XML format over my entire account history. My goals for this project are to: 

1. Create an analytics dashboard so I can have better insight to my energy usage.
2. Enable me to choose the best price plan based on my energy usage.
3. Forecast the change in my usage with the addition of an electric vehicle and installed level 2 charger to the home.
